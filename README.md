# Agino: Crop Cutting Date Estimation App

## Overview

Agino is a mobile application that assists farmers in knowing the cutting date of a crop based on Growing Degree Degree (GDD) calculations. The project uses mock sensor data for testing purposes and fetches weather data from the Met API for accurate GDD calculations. By providing valuable insights, Agino empowers farmers to optimize crop harvesting and improve their overall yield and quality. Clean Architecture is used both for the backend and the frontend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can securely create accounts and log in to access the app's features.

- **Location-Based Weather Data**: Agino utilizes the Met API to retrieve location-specific weather data for precise GDD calculations.

- **GDD Calculation**: The app calculates the Growing Degree Days (GDD) required based on the base temperature provided.

- **Cutting Date Estimation**: Based on GDD calculations, Agino estimates the ideal cutting date.

- **Mock Sensor Data**: For testing and development, Agino offers an option to use mock sensor data.
